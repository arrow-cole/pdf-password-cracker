# PDF Password Cracker

PDF Password Cracker is a web-based application that assists in cracking passwords for PDF files using a brute-force technique. It
 is designed to aid cyber professionals and authorized forensic investigators in password recovery scenarios. Please note that this application is for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly and legally.

## PDF Usage and Password Protection

PDF (Portable Document Format) is a widely used file format for document sharing and preservation. It supports various security features, including password-based encryption. A password-protected PDF requires a password to open or perform certain operations on the file.

## Brute Force Cracking

Brute force cracking is a password recovery technique that involves systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct password is found. In the case of PDF Password Cracker, it utilizes a user-provided wordlist to test each password against the password-protected PDF file.

## Usage Steps

1. Upload PDF File: Select or drag and drop a PDF file into the application. The application will check if the PDF is password-protected. If not, an alert will be displayed indicating that the PDF does not have a password.

2. Upload Wordlist: If the PDF is password-protected, proceed to upload a text file containing a wordlist. The wordlist should contain potential passwords, with each password on a separate line.

3. Crack Password: Click the "Crack Password" button to start the password cracking process. The application will iterate through each line of the wordlist and test the passwords against the PDF file using brute-force techniques.

4. Password Found: If a matching password is found, it will be displayed in the "Password Found" section. You can then copy the password using the "Copy Password" button.

## Outputs and Results

- If the uploaded PDF file is not password-protected, an alert will be displayed indicating that the PDF does not have a password.

- If the uploaded PDF file is password-protected and a matching password is found in the wordlist, the password will be displayed in the "Password Found" section.

- If no matching password is found in the wordlist, an alert will be displayed indicating that the password is not present. You can try again by refreshing the page and uploading a new wordlist.

## Advantages and Forensics Investigation

PDF Password Cracker offers several advantages in the field of forensics investigation:

- Password Recovery: It helps forensic investigators in recovering passwords from password-protected PDF files, aiding in the analysis of evidence.

- Time-Saving: The application automates the process of trying multiple passwords, saving time and effort compared to manual password cracking.

- Educational Purposes: PDF Password Cracker serves as an educational tool to understand the concept of password cracking and the importance of strong passwords.
